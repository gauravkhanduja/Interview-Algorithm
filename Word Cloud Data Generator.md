You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text. 

To do this youâ€™ll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a [Hashmap Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-hashmap) or [map Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words occurred.

Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences:

```
"After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:"
"Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar."
```

What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your final dictionary should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of 2. Make reasonable (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like "After" and "Dana".
